# TXRG

WIP for new TXRG website, this is a [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.com/) blog powered by [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com).

This is based on a version of the [Gatsby Contentful Starter](https://github.com/contentful-userland/gatsby-contentful-starter) which is maintained by our Community.

## Getting started

See our [official Contentful getting started guide](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/get-started/).

## Development

### `yarn dev`

Run the project locally with live reload in development mode.

### `yarn build`

Run a production build into `./public`. The result is ready to be put on any static hosting you prefer.

### `yarn serve`

Spin up a production-ready server with your blog. Don't forget to build your page beforehand.
